* My dotfiles
These are my dotfiles, enjoy.
My home laptops are two thinkpads, a T480 and a T490s.
I've been trying hard to get udev rules to work on my T480 but to no avail.

* Arch Linux screen installation
See this page https://miikanissi.com/blog/hotplug-dual-monitor-setup-bspwm/

You need to setup a udev rule
In **/etc/udev/rules.d/99-reload-monitor.rules**
#+begin_src bash
ACTION=="change", SUBSYSTEM=="drm", RUN+="/bin/su __USERNAME__ --command='systemctl --user start bspwm-reload.service'"
#+end_src

** Emacs 
I'm using emacs and org-tangle to keep track of my configuration, inspired by
David Wilson.

** Gnu Stow
*** Usage
 - Checkout repo.
 - run `stow shared archie` in directory for my home laptops and only `shared` for my work laptop
